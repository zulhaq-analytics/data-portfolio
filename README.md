## 💡 My Approach to Analytics

I build BI solutions that balance technical rigor with business usability. My dashboards prioritize actionable insights over data density, and I design data models for long-term maintainability, not just quick wins. Every metric I track ties directly to a business decision or operational workflow.

### 1️⃣ **Account Rotation (3+3) – Customer Engagement Model**

**The Challenge:** Sales teams needed an automated way to identify inactive accounts and optimize trader workload distribution based on customer engagement patterns.

**The Solution:** Built a Power BI model that evaluates customer activity across 3-month enquiry and deal windows to classify accounts as **Healthy**, **Rotatable**, **At Risk**, or **Reassigned**. Includes engagement scoring logic, rotation timing triggers, and trader workload distribution insights.

**Technical Highlights:**
- Custom DAX engagement scoring using CALCULATE, FILTER, and time intelligence functions
- Dynamic classification logic handling 6,000+ customer accounts
- Star schema with relationship-based filtering for multi-trader analysis

**Impact:** Reduced manual account review time from 8 hours to 15 minutes weekly, enabling proactive customer retention strategies.

📅 **Built:** November 2024

### 2️⃣ **Bunker Opportunities Overview – Vessel Activity & Demand Forecasting**

**The Challenge:** Bunker trading teams needed to identify high-probability sales opportunities from thousands of daily vessel movements without manual tracking.

**The Solution:** A maritime intelligence dashboard that analyzes vessel movement patterns, ETA forecasts, last bunker purchase history, and STS (Ship-to-Ship) operations to identify upcoming refueling opportunities. Features a custom **High Potential Engine** that ranks vessels by bunker likelihood using 8+ weighted factors.

**Technical Highlights:**
- Predictive scoring algorithm combining temporal, behavioral, and operational data
- Power Query transformations handling 50,000+ daily vessel position updates
- Geospatial filtering for port proximity analysis

**Impact:** Increased sales team efficiency by 30-40% through automated opportunity identification and prioritization.

### 3️⃣ **Cash Utilization Tracker – Allocation, Forecasting & Liquidity Insights**

**The Challenge:** Finance teams needed real-time visibility into cash allocation across counterparties with forward-looking liquidity projections to prevent funding shortfalls.

**The Solution:** A comprehensive Power BI dashboard tracking **running cash utilization**, **allocation limits**, **90-day forward projections**, and **overdue AR/AP**. Includes scenario modeling for credit exposure management.

**Technical Highlights:**
- Star schema with fiscal calendar and counterparty hierarchies
- DAX measures for running totals, variance analysis, and rolling forecasts
- Python integration for time-series projection calculations

**Impact:** Prevented 3-5 potential cash shortfalls per quarter through proactive liquidity monitoring and early warning alerts.
