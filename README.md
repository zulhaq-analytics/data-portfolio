## 💡 My Approach to Analytics

I build BI solutions that balance **technical rigor with business usability**. Dashboards prioritize actionable insights, not data overload, and models are designed for long-term maintainability. Every KPI ties back to a real operational or commercial decision.

## 1️⃣ **Account Rotation (3+3) – Customer Engagement Model**

**Challenge:**  
Sales teams lacked a structured way to identify inactive or declining accounts and distribute trader workload based on engagement trends.

**Solution:**  
A Power BI model evaluating customer activity across 3-month enquiry and deal windows. Accounts are classified as:  
**Healthy**, **Rotatable**, **At Risk**, or **Reassigned** — with automated alerts and workload insights.

**Technical Highlights:**
- Complex engagement scoring using CALCULATE, FILTER, and time intelligence
- Handles 6,000+ accounts with dynamic classification logic  
- Star schema enabling multi-trader, multi-office views

**Impact:**  
Reduced manual account review from **8 hours to 15 minutes weekly**, improving retention follow-up strategies.

## 2️⃣ **Bunker Opportunities Overview – Vessel Activity & Demand Forecasting**

**Challenge:**  
Traders needed a way to identify high-probability bunker leads from tens of thousands of vessel movements daily.

**Solution:**  
A maritime intelligence dashboard analyzing vessel movement, ETA forecasts, last bunker history, and STS operations.  
Includes a **High Potential Engine** that scores vessels based on 8+ weighted behavioral, temporal, and operational factors.

**Technical Highlights:**
- Predictive scoring logic for bunker likelihood  
- Power Query processing 50,000+ vessel updates  
- Geospatial filtering and port-proximity logic

**Impact:**  
Improved trader efficiency by **30–40%** through automated opportunity prioritization.

## 3️⃣ **Cash Utilization Tracker – Allocation, Forecasting & Liquidity Insights**

**Challenge:**  
Finance teams needed better visibility into cash allocation, supplier outflows, collection timelines, and forward exposure.

**Solution:**  
A Power BI dashboard tracking **running utilization**, **allocation limits**, **90-day projections**, and **overdue AR/AP**, with scenario modeling and forecasting.

**Technical Highlights:**
- Star schema with fiscal calendar and counterparty hierarchies  
- DAX for running totals, rolling forecasts, and variance analysis  
- Python-backed time-series projections (optional)

**Impact:**  
Helped prevent **3–5 potential cash shortfalls per quarter** through proactive monitoring and alerts.
