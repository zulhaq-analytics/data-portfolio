## 📊 BI Maturity Assessment

Use this framework to assess where your organization stands:

| Level | Characteristics | Goal |
|-------|-----------------|------|
| **1 - Ad Hoc** | Excel exports, no central BI, tribal knowledge | Establish first dashboards |
| **2 - Developing** | Some Power BI reports, inconsistent standards | Adopt governance basics |
| **3 - Defined** | Standards exist, RLS implemented, documentation | Scale self-service |
| **4 - Managed** | Metrics on adoption, automated refresh, CI/CD | Optimize performance |
| **5 - Optimized** | BI embedded in decisions, continuous improvement | Strategic analytics |
